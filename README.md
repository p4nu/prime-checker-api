# Prime checker API

## What is this?

This is a backend REST API for testing if a number or a sum of numbers is prime or not. Nothing fancy. Made with ❤ in Windows 10.

## What are you trying to achieve with these?

To land a job. I'm serious.

## Okay, so how do I run this?

If you know what this repo is about before reading the paragraphs above, please follow these steps if you really need.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
  - LTS version is a good one with this.

### 1. Clone a repo

Not really worth listing this here, but I want to be precise with my steps.

### 2. `npm install`

Let there be dependencies.

### 3. Run the project!

#### For PowerShell (Recommended, but no matter):

`PS> $env:DEBUG='myapp:*'; npm start`

#### For Mac or Linux users:

`$ DEBUG=myapp:* npm start`

#### For Windows command prompt:

`> set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start`

### 4. The server is up.

It's in localhost:3000

### 5. (Optional) Head into frontend project and follow more steps

It's fun.

## How would you host this in Azure?
